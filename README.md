1. Create an incoming webhook app in Slack
The first step is to generate an incoming webhook URL in Slack that you can use later. If you already have an incoming webhook you may use that and skip to setting up the SuccessPlay in Totango in Step 2.

> Go to api.slack.com and click on "Create a new Slack App"
> Provide an App Name and choose the right workspace
> Once created go to "Incoming Webhooks"
> Turn on Activate Incoming Webhooks and also click Add New Webhook to Workspace
> Choose app channel to post the survey responses to.
> Copy the webhook URL

2. Replace YOURURL
Replace YOURURL with the URL you copied from the previous step.
